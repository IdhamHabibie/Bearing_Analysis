# Anomaly Detection on Machine Failures Based on 4 different Bearings.
## Introduction
In this repository, I am going to analyse the Anomaly Detection based on Time-Series Model on Machine Failures with 4 different bearings. I am using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with noise) to
identify the anomaly detection. The basic concept of DBSCAN is to group together the closest dataset value, where the outliers are lied alone
in this method. The method to group the associate datasets is identified using **Epsilon** which defines the radius of grouping.

## DB-SCAN
DB-SCAN is an unsupervised learning method that aims
